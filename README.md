You can either choose to do the labeling manually or choose to run the labelling process with bots wich implement a random labeling  or machine labeling algorithm.

Special thanks to Muhammed Fatih Öztel, Huzeyfe Ayaz, and Sameeh Kunbargi for their major contributions.


# Project 2 
The second project is a system implemented in Python which is an analysator tool for Zoom poll reports that can be downloaded from the Zoom website. The requires a student list wich is in the format that our university website provides in order to match the students to the poll reports. The system generates a general report for all the polls provided, a report for each student for each poll, and a report on each question for each poll with the according graphs.
